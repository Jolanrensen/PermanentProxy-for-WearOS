    <string name="app_name">Permanent Proxy</string>
    <string name="wrapper_app">This app is just a phone companion of Permanent Proxy. Please install Permanent Proxy from the Play Store on you Wear OS watch. The app can be found in the \"Apps on your Phone\" section.</string>
    <string name="instructions"><![CDATA[Please read carefully:\nTo get started, first enable the Developer Options of your watch, which can be achieved by going to Settings -> System -> About and tap the Build number until you are a \"developer\".\nNext, go to Settings -> Developer options and enable \"ADB debugging\" and \"Debug over Bluetooth\".\nFinally start up Permanent Proxy, request permission and press \"Allow\" or \"Always allow this Computer\" if prompted.\nAfter the app has gotten permission, ADB can be turned off again unless you want to disable the proxy.\n\nNow you can get started! Simply enter a proxy address and port, enable it and you\'re done! If you reboot, the proxy will remain.\n\nProxy services can be found online and can be from any country. However, do make sure your proxy works and you completely trust the proxy you chose before you enter it! All the data of your watch might be sent through that proxy, even sensitive data, so act at your own risk.]]></string>
    <string name="old_watch">Some older watches are not powerful enough to get Secure Settings permission by itself using my method. If this is the case for your watch, you will need a PC to grant Permanent Proxy permission. The instructions are also available in the app description.\n\nFirst make sure to connect your watch to your PC via ADB. You can Google how to do this, there are lots of tutorials. When your watch is connected, use the command \n\nadb shell pm grant nl.jolanrensen.permanentproxy android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\n\nto give Permanent Proxy the permissions needed to turn on/edit the proxy.\n\nTo turn off the proxy, connect to your PC in the same manner as before, but now you will need the following command: \n\nadb shell settings delete global http_proxy; adb shell settings delete global global_http_proxy_host; adb shell settings delete global global_http_proxy_port; adb shell settings delete global global_http_proxy_exclusion_list; adb shell settings delete global global_proxy_pac_url; adb shell reboot</string>
